# ESG Metrics Web Application

The ESG Metrics Web Application leverages the power of AI and Cloud Technologies to unveil critical sustainability metrics. This prototype application is designed for developers and operations personnel responsible for deploying and maintaining the application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with OpenAI API integration.

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project set up.
- OpenAI API key.
- Git version control system.
- Familiarity with Google Cloud SDK, Cloud Run, and Bigtable.

## Tools

- **Git**: Version control.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Command-line tools for Google Cloud.
- **Google Cloud Run**: Managed platform for deploying containerized applications.
- **Google Bigtable**: NoSQL database for large analytical and operational workloads.

## Stages

### Development

- Clone the Git repository and set up the development environment.
- Follow coding standards and best practices for application development.
- Utilize pytest for automated unit testing.

### Testing

- Perform automated integration testing using Selenium or pytest-docker.
- Conduct manual testing to ensure user experience and functionality.

### Deployment

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Terraform for creating GCP resources.
2. **Containerization**: Build Docker images for Flask and Streamlit applications, and the OpenAI API script.
3. **Deployment**: Utilize Google Cloud Run for deploying the application, ensuring environment variables are securely managed.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Implement application logs with Python logging and centralize using Stackdriver Logging.
- Set up Cloud Monitoring for GCP resources and application health checks.

### Updates and Rollbacks

- Define a CI/CD pipeline for seamless updates and incorporate a rollback strategy for version management.

## Security Considerations

- This prototype lacks user authentication. Implement authentication and authorization for production.
- Manage sensitive information securely using environment variables or secret management tools.
- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or Harness to automate testing and deployment.

## Getting Started
